## Exemplar: Identifying stakeholders
## Introduction
In the exercise Identifying stakeholders, you were tasked with identifying the key stakeholders to interview for the sales data analysis project.

More specifically, you were asked to:

Identify and list the key stakeholders that you will interview as part of your data analysis project, their level of influence and/or their interest in the project, and the reason you selected them. 

Write a list of 3 questions that you will ask each stakeholder that could help direct the data analysis in achieving the project goals. 

This reading presents one version of the expected outcome. Your answer may differ but still be correct.

### Step 1: Understand the context
In the first part of the exercise, your task was to read the case study carefully to understand the context and goals. An example of an acceptable answer for this is:

The primary objective of the analysis is to analyze the sales data to drive new marketing campaigns and improve the company's market share. To do this effectively, a full understanding of the business context and the challenges the company faces is required. In addition, familiarity with the stakeholder’s role and duties is essential.

### Step 2: Identify the key stakeholders
In this step, you were asked to identify and list the key stakeholders that you think should be interviewed and give the reason you selected them. Then you were asked to classify the chosen stakeholders by the level of influence and interest each might have in the sales data analysis project. 3 examples of the type of work that you could have submitted for this step of the exercise are presented below.

Key stakeholder: Sales Manager - Kane
Level of influence: High—Kane's high level of influence comes from his role as Sales Manager and his responsibility to ensure that the sales team meets their targets. Kane's deep understanding of the company's sales processes and performance directly impacts the company's bottom line. As a result, Kane's involvement in the sales data analysis project is essential to ensure that the project aligns with the company's overall sales goals.

Level of interest: High—Kane's high level of interest in the project comes from his responsibility to improve the sales team's performance. The insights gained from the sales data analysis will help Kane identify areas where the sales team can improve, allowing data-driven decisions that will enhance the sales process and increase the company's market share.

Reason for selection: Directly involved in sales performance and understanding customer preferences. Kane plays a critical role in the success of the sales data analysis project and, as Sales Manager, is directly responsible for the company's sales performance. Kane's expertise in analyzing sales data, understanding customer preferences, and identifying trends make him an important asset.

Key stakeholder: Marketing Director - Renee
Level of influence: High—Renee's high level of influence comes from her role as Marketing Director, where her responsibility is to drive marketing campaigns that boost the company's sales. Renee's insights into the effectiveness of existing marketing campaigns, customer preferences, and trends will help create a targeted analysis that can inform future marketing strategies.

Level of interest: High—Renee's high level of interest in the project is rooted in her responsibility to improve the company's market share and attract new customers. The sales data analysis will help her identify trends and customer preferences, allowing her to make data-driven decisions to create more effective marketing campaigns that resonate with the target audience.

Reason for selection: Directly involved in creating and implementing marketing campaigns. Renee is a key stakeholder in the sales data analysis project because she creates and implements marketing campaigns that promote the company's products and services. Renee's extensive experience in marketing, deep understanding of the company's marketing strategy, and ability to identify areas for improvement make her a vital source for the project.

Key stakeholder: Customer Service Manager - Ricci
Level of influence: Medium—Ricci's medium level of influence is due to her role in customer service, which, while not directly responsible for sales or marketing, plays a crucial role in retaining existing customers and maintaining the company's reputation. Ricci's insights into customer satisfaction can help the data analyst understand the factors that impact the company's sales and inform recommendations for improving the customer experience.

Level of interest: High—Ricci's high level of interest in the project comes from her responsibility to ensure that customers are satisfied with the company's products and services. The sales data analysis will help her identify trends and areas of improvement, allowing Ricci to make data-driven decisions to enhance customer satisfaction and contribute to the company's overall sales and market share.

Reason for selection: Directly involved in customer satisfaction and feedback, Ricci is an important stakeholder in the sales data analysis project because of her role in ensuring customer satisfaction. Ricci’s understanding of customer complaints, feedback, and preferences can provide valuable insights into areas where the company can improve its products and services. These insights can help the data analyst identify growth opportunities and inform future sales and marketing strategies.

### Step 3: Prepare interview questions
