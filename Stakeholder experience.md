## Stakeholder experience

### Introduction
You now know that creating and designing visualizations are an important part of the data analysis process. You learned that these visualizations can help stakeholders understand trends and patterns and can help them make informed business decisions. Visualizations work best when your design connects with your audience. For example, designs created to present to marketing managers may not work well with a group of financial investors. That's where understanding the background, needs, preferences, and expectations of the end-users of your analysis, or stakeholder experience, comes in.

In this reading, you’ll learn about stakeholder experience and its importance for data visualization. You’ll discover the role stakeholder experience plays in creating effective data visualizations and how this can impact stakeholder decision-making and business outcomes.

### Stakeholder experience
Taking stakeholder experience into account is a critical aspect of data visualization and analysis. Stakeholder experience refers to the specific needs, preferences, and expectations of the stakeholders engaging with the visualizations and insights provided in a data analysis report. These stakeholders can include executives, managers, employees, clients, and partners—anyone with a vested interest in the data insights or can use them to make informed decisions. By acknowledging and catering to stakeholder experience, data analysts can enhance the effectiveness and usability of their visualizations, which in turn leads to better decision-making, increased collaboration, and improved business outcomes.

The importance of stakeholder experience in data visualization
Stakeholder experience is an important part of data visualization and analysis because it impacts how relevant, useful, and understandable the visualizations and analysis are. This is because tailored and appealing visualizations make it easier for stakeholders to comprehend and use data insights to make decisions, improving the communication of data insights and encouraging stakeholders to engage more with them. By showing that you understand the stakeholders' goals and priorities, stakeholders are more likely to trust in your ability to provide valuable insights, leading to greater acceptance and use of the analysis, more data-driven decisions, and positive business outcomes. In addition to driving business value, visualizations tailored according to stakeholder experience can also save time and resources by reducing the need for multiple iterations and revisions.

Factors that influence stakeholder experience
To gain a comprehensive insight into stakeholder experience, data analysts should consider factors such as the goals and objectives, and technical expertise of the stakeholders, as well as the context in which the stakeholders use and apply the analysis insights.

### Goals and objectives
Identifying the primary goals and objectives of stakeholders will help align your visualizations and insights with the stakeholders' interests and expectations, leading to a more targeted and effective presentation. This process involves:

Identifying stakeholder priorities: Determine the key concerns, challenges, and opportunities that stakeholders want to address with the data analysis.

Clarifying decision-making needs: Understand the types of decisions stakeholders will be making based on the data insights.

Establishing success criteria: Work with stakeholders to define specific, measurable, and achievable objectives for the data analysis project.

Aligning with organizational strategy: Consider the broader strategic context in which stakeholders operate and ensure that the visualizations and insights contribute to achieving the organization's overall goals and objectives.

### Technical expertise
Understanding the stakeholders' level of technical expertise is crucial in determining the complexity and depth of the visualizations. This includes:

Assessing stakeholder proficiency: Gauge the stakeholders' familiarity with data analysis concepts, tools, and techniques to determine their level of expertise.

Tailoring visualizations: Based on the stakeholders' expertise, create visualizations that are appropriately detailed and sophisticated.

Providing context and explanations: Include clear explanations, annotations, and supporting information to help stakeholders with varying levels of expertise interpret and understand the visualizations.

Offering training and support: For stakeholders who may require additional assistance in understanding the visualizations, consider providing training or support resources, such as tutorials.

### Context and application
Knowing the context in which stakeholders will use the visualizations enables you to design visualizations that are relevant, actionable, and easily applicable to the stakeholders' specific situations. This entails:

Understanding stakeholder workflows: Identify how stakeholders will incorporate the visualizations into their daily workflows and decision-making processes.

Identifying the intended audience: Consider the specific groups or individuals who will be using the visualizations and design them accordingly.

Considering the environment: Take into account the physical or digital environment in which stakeholders will view the visualizations. Factors such as screen size, device type, and network connectivity can impact the design and functionality of visualizations.

Adapting to stakeholder feedback: Gather feedback from stakeholders throughout the visualization development process and make adjustments as needed to ensure that the visualizations remain relevant, actionable, and easily applicable to their specific situations.

### Conclusion
