## Sharing data insights

### Introduction
Imagine you are part of the data analytics team at Adventure Works that has just completed a ground-breaking analysis. Your insights have the potential to revolutionize the way the company makes decisions. But, before you can share your work with others, you need to ensure it's accessible, visually appealing, and secure. This is where the best practices for sharing data insights come into operation.

In this reading, you will learn about the best practices for sharing and collaborating on analysis insights, focusing on the key considerations of accessibility, color schemes, font sizes, access and security, and storage and refresh schedules. You’ll discover how to share and collaborate on reports, ensuring they are engaging, accessible, and secure while keeping them up-to-date with the latest data.

Best practices for sharing data insights in reports
Let’s say, Renee, the marketing director at Adventure Works, tasked the analytics team you’re a part of to analyze sales data to identify trends and patterns that could help improve their marketing strategies. You and your colleagues examined and analyzed the data for weeks, creating stunning visualizations, and drawing valuable conclusions. To maximize the impact of your data insights, you now need to apply the best practices for sharing reports.

Let’s explore these best practices and how you and the data analytics team can apply them to effectively share and collaborate on data insights with Renee and other stakeholders at Adventure Works.

### Accessibility
A key consideration when sharing analysis insights is accessibility. This means you need to ensure that the reports are accessible to everyone who needs to view them. For example, you need to consider any disabilities or limitations that might affect stakeholders’ ability to interact with the data. To overcome this challenge in the Adventure Works project, your report must meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to accommodate users with disabilities. For more information on the WCAG, you can refer to the additional resources for this lesson. 

You must also consider the various devices and platforms used by the audience to which your report is aimed. For example, you can ensure that your report and visualizations are designed to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions so that the report renders well on different devices. You can also consider cross-browser compatibility to ensure that your report’s appearance and functionality are consistent across different web browsers. You may also make the report available for offline and online use and provide the report in various file formats and with different export options, to accommodate users' preferences and ensure they can access the information in the way that works best for them.

By addressing these factors, you can ensure your report is accessible and user-friendly, regardless of the devices and platforms the stakeholders use.

### Color schemes and font sizes
You must also consider the visual appeal of your report, as a well-designed report is more engaging and easier to understand. How could this look practically? In the Adventure Works project, your team could research color theory and design principles, choosing a color scheme that is visually appealing and clear. Your team could also adjust font sizes to ensure that the text is readable and can be quickly and accurately processed, improving comprehension. Remember that when creating reports and dashboards, it's essential to ensure they are accessible to all users, including those with visual impairments.

### Access and security
Another key consideration is ensuring the report is secure and accessible only to authorized users. For the Adventure Works project, your team must balance making the data easy to access and protecting sensitive information. To achieve this, you could implement role-based access control, which grants different levels of access to the report depending on the user's role within the company. You could also ensure that the environment is configured securely by enabling security features like data encryption and multi-factor authentication. In sum, before sharing a report, you need to consider who should have access to the data and how to maintain its security. 

### Storage and refresh schedules
Finally, it’s best practice to consider the storage and refresh schedules for generated reports. This means the data analytics team would need to ensure that the report is always up-to-date and that the data storage and processing don’t exceed Adventure Works’ capacity. To do this practically, you could set up automated data refreshes to keep the report current and monitor the storage and processing requirements to ensure that they remain within acceptable limits. When sharing your reports, it’s important to consider how your data is stored and how often it should be refreshed to ensure stakeholders are always working with up-to-date information.

### Conclusion
As you can tell from the Adventure Works sales data project, sharing data insights is about much more than simply clicking the Share button. It requires careful planning and consideration of factors like accessibility, visual design, security, and data management. By mastering these fundamental principles and implementing best practices in sharing your reports, you'll empower your audience with the valuable insights they need to make data-driven decisions. So, in your data analysis work, you’ll be able to share your data stories with stakeholders and inspire change through the power of well-presented, accessible, and secure data insights!
